# CS-305-Software-security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The client that we used in this example was looking for a development team to create a secure server for their online banking application. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I found that I identified vulnerabilities and understood the process of implementing the OWASP Dependency Check solution. I struggled at first to understand how the tool operated and where I could find the dependency report. After that, it was smooth sailing and I enjoyed going through the reports to suppress false positives.  

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The task of filtering the assessment was tedious but rewarding. Some of the reports ended up very long and dry. However, when going through the reports and researching the history behind the report and why it was flagged. It became pretty fun. 


How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I took into account the flow diagram we were provided to ensure that I had more than half of the key points utilized in my code. This gives many layers of protection which provides peace of mind for me knowing that the server was that much more secure. In the future, I would likely use the dependency check tool again to highlight vulnerabilities in a program. 


How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I established a baseline for the program by running the dependency check tool and capturing all the listed vulnerabilities. From there, I would test the code often to ensure that I did not introduce any new vulnerabilities or break the program.


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I found myself referring to Java’s oracle documentation on secure coding. I find that document to be a little hard to read, but full of information. I utilized many of the coding practices that it outlined to ensure that I was making a quality product. 


Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would consider showing employers the way I was able to incorporate the OWASP security check. I could highlight the knowledge that I gained from having ensured that the tool integrated and ran smoothly.
